# Stalker like anomalies for Arma 3
This is a small side project of mine to create some anomalies like they are found in the STALKER game series. By no means are these feature complete and there are still tons of bugs. I started working on this as I noticed a lack of available addons or mods that offer anomalies, like they are found in the zone.

If you like this idea and want to contribute, just do a pull request.
If you want to use this in a mission, sure go ahead, but please write me in the credits.

This project is aiming to be compatible with addons CBA and ACE. It should work in single and multiplayer. It tries to use as much content as vanilla offers, so this project can be implemented on mission basis and does not need any addons (besides CBA and ACE).

Currently in:
* Anomalies:
    * Springboard
    * Meatgrinder
    * Electra
    * Burner
    * Teleport
* Anomaly detector in ACE self-interact (no item requirement)
* System to show anomalies only around players to safe those scarce FPS

Planned:
* Anomaly detector needs a configured item (probably the banana)
* Some more anomalies
* Respawn support
* Handling for anything dropping into an anomaly that is not human
